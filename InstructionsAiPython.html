    <ol>
        <li>Every function should have a one line docstring</li>
        <li>All const should be at the top, below the imports in all caps</li>
        <li>Use underscores for variable names</li>
        <li>All functions should have a single responsibility</li>
        <li>Use is not operator rather than not ... is</li>
        <li>Use list comprehensions and generator expressions for simple cases</li>
        <li>All functions and variables should have very descriptive names</li>
        <li>Add print statements after every action for easier debugging</li>
        <li>Use classes and object-oriented programming where appropriate</li>
        <li>Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code</li>
        <li>Write tests for your code to ensure it works as expected</li>
        <li>Use comments sparingly and only where necessary. Good code should be self-explanatory</li>
        <li>Avoid using global variables as much as possible</li>
        <li>Use appropriate data structures for the task at hand</li>
