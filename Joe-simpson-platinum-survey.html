                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">General Business Information</h2>
                <p><strong>Start Date:</strong> August 2022</p>
                <p><strong>Total Revenue:</strong> Just a hair over a million dollars (USD)</p>
                <p><strong>Last Month's Revenue:</strong> $20,000 (USD)</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong> At least get back to what I was previously doing monthly, 50k on average. Long-term goals would be 100k/mo or 1 mil a year.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> I have not done any paid advertising, and basically only used YouTube for organic traffic. Had a baby 3 months ago, so life sort of got in the way a little bit. We launched with the price being 50% off, making it $297 which I think was the sweet spot. We did a "the 50% off sale is ending sale - which did 70k" however after that the $597 price dried up sales altogether basically. Currently doing a "summer sale" at $497 and sales are up a lot. So there is some pricing stuff to sort out.</p>

                <p>Ideal Customer: Somebody who has Holley EFI on their car and wants to learn how to tune it themselves, typically more beginners but we do have plenty of advanced users and professional tuners as members as well.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Offer and Product</h2>
                <p><strong>Free Offers:</strong> Most traffic just comes from YouTube content. All lead magnets for the most part have been downloadable PDFs. I started a public Facebook group that just hit 10k members. We ask for an email address to send free training to, so that has generated thousands of leads.</p>
                <p><strong>Low-Ticket Offers:</strong> Low ticket is on the to-do list.</p>
                <p><strong>Mid-Ticket Offers:</strong> Course is currently mid-ticket and the only thing I offer.</p>
                <p><strong>High-Ticket Offers:</strong> I plan to get my feet wet with high-ticket with my new training course that is about to launch - that is about the business side of car tuning.</p>
                <p><strong>Subscription Offers:</strong> My new training will be recurring/monthly payment based. Need a little help with pricing especially for the initial launch. It will include a course, group coaching calls, private Facebook group, private Discord, and hopefully add more stuff to make it sticky.</p>
