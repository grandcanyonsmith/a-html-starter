Employee:  John Schmidt 
Review Date: Nov 11, 2021   
MCP Period: 2nd half 2021
Leader: Jane Fonda

Accomplishments:  This has been a good year for John in several ways.  Peter Gabriel was hired as a new member to the team and the majority of training fell to John to bring Peter up to speed and begin to delegate tasks.  There were some challenging steps along the way, that pushed John to set up and configure several databases, work with operations to provision and permission them correctly.  These challenged John and the team, but they were able to successfully complete the project on time.  Through those challenges, John has been able to keep a positive attitude and rapport with the team and has offloaded the majority of his tasks to Peter.  In addition to this change, John has transitioned to more of a Technical Analyst role and has managed the security vulnerabilities task list, trained with test engineering to be able to handle production issues and he has been a huge help on several projects by dealing with more difficult queries, testing, and troubleshooting.  I have appreciated Johnâ€™s willingness to change roles and to accept new assignments as well as his detailed analysis.

Opportunities for Improvement:  As John continues to operate in his new role and he continues to learn more about the overall landscape of technology and applications, I expect that he would be able to find out root causes to issues independently, report them, and resolve them.  John likes to ensure that he has a confirmed understanding and well documented approach to his projects.  This can be a benefit and it can also take more time than the development needed for resolution.  He will need to find a balance to thorough research and decisive action.
