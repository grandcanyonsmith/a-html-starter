        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Accomplishments:</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">Canyon began working at OC Tanner in the apprenticeship program in the beginning of August. He has been instrumental in teaching the team Prompt programming, implementing AWS, and running tests using Lambda. He and the team have created the first suite of Python tests. Canyon utilized AWS resources to allow these tests to be run on the cloud, and display the tests results on a dashboard that he and the team created to give more visibility to our executive management. He also created a useful dashboard. Additionally, he has given the team capacitations on how to use openai api to build projects, capacitations on Python, and capacitations on AWS basics such as EC2 and AWS Lambda. One of the accomplishments he is most proud of is a solution that he's been working on that will allow testers at OC Tanner to work with AI for writing and fixing tests that uses AWS, Terraform, and OpenAI.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Opportunities for Improvement:</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">As Canyon continues to operate in his new role, he could improve daily updates to manager, and have better documentation in confluence of what he's working on. He could also improve contributing more on maintenance weeks.</p>
