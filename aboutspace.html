            <p class="mt-2">Space is a vast, seemingly infinite expanse that exists beyond the Earth and between celestial bodies. It is a place of mystery and wonder, filled with countless stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. It is the final frontier of human exploration.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">Space is not completely empty but consists of a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.</p>
