Apologies for the misunderstanding, but the content provided appears to be HTML code, not CSS. Also, if you're referring to the external CSS file 'newstyle.css' attached through the link tag in the HTML, the contents of this external file have not been provided. CSS files would typically contain styling rules for the HTML elements on the page, such as color, margins, padding, font size, etc. 

Would you be able to provide the CSS code you're asking for a review on, or could you clarify your request further?
