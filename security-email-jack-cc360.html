              <p style="font-weight:bold;">I saw that you had basically two different options as far as the software membership for kind of what I would need to be in the same realm as what I'm paying for Kajabi. There's one for like $147, and then I saw one for $197.</p>
              <p style="color:#4a5568; margin-top:8px;">That's correct! And I know that switching platforms can be a big decision, especially when considering costs and features. We offer two plans that might suit your needs:</p>
              <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left:24px; color:#4a5568; margin-top:8px;">
                <li><strong>Premium Plan ($147/month):</strong> This plan includes all the essential features you need to build and launch your courses, including unlimited courses, community features, and basic integrations.</li>
                <li><strong>Elite Plan ($197/month):</strong> In addition to everything in the Premium Plan, the Elite Plan offers advanced features like priority support, enhanced automation, and additional integrations.</li>
              </ul>
              <p style="color:#4a5568; margin-top:8px;">Based on your requirements and to match what you're getting with Kajabi, the Premium Plan might be the best fit. However, if you need more advanced features, the Elite Plan would be ideal.</p>
