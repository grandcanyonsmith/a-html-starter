      <p>Hi [Recipient's Name],</p>
      <p class="mt-4">It was great speaking with you earlier. As promised, here are the answers to the questions you asked about Course Creator 360:</p>
      
      <!-- Section 1 -->
      <div class="mt-8 border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl text-red-600 mb-4">1. Shopify Integration</h2>
        <p><strong>Can products from Shopify and courses on Course Creator 360 be purchased together in one checkout?</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Currently, combining Shopify products and CC360 courses into a single unified checkout isn't supported. Customers need to complete separate checkouts: one on your Shopify store for physical products and another on CC360 for courses or digital products.</p>
        
        <p class="mt-4"><strong>How does inventory reconcile if a kit is sold along with a course?</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Real-time inventory synchronization during the CC360 checkout process isn't available by default. However, you can use webhooks to send data to or from Course Creator 360 automations. If someone checks out a product in Shopify, you can set up an automation that grants access to that user to the course. This allows you to link physical product sales in Shopify with course access in CC360, providing a seamless experience for your customers.</p>

      <!-- Section 2 -->
      <div class="mt-8 border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl text-red-600 mb-4">2. Anti-Piracy Measures</h2>
        <p><strong>What anti-piracy measures are in place on the Course Creator 360 platform?</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">CC360 provides basic content protection by requiring users to log in to access course materials. It doesn't offer advanced Digital Rights Management (DRM) features or encryption specifically designed to prevent piracy.</p>
        
        <p class="mt-4"><strong>Can the system detect screen recording or prevent piracy (e.g., through OBS or other screen recording tools)?</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">No, CC360 doesn't have the capability to detect or prevent screen recording through tools like OBS.</p>
        
        <p class="mt-4"><strong>What support is available if the course content gets pirated? Can Course Creator 360 assist with DMCA takedowns or any other anti-piracy enforcement?</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">CC360 doesn't provide direct support for anti-piracy enforcement or assistance with DMCA takedown notices. You would need to handle detection and takedown requests independently or through third-party services.</p>

        <p class="mt-4"><strong>Does the affiliate program set a cookie for tracking purchases over multiple sessions, or is it only within the same session?</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">CC360 uses cookies to track affiliate referrals, and you can set the cookie duration according to your preference (e.g., 30 days).</p>
        
        <p class="mt-4"><strong>What is the onboarding process for affiliates, and can you set up an affiliate on their behalf?</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Affiliates can sign up through a custom sign-up page, or you can manually add them to the system on their behalf.</p>

        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Currently, our community feature offers basic moderation tools but doesn't include advanced auto-moderation capabilities like automatic filtering or censoring of offensive language.</p>
