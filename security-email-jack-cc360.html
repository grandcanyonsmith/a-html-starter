              <p>Hi [Recipient's Name],</p>
              <p class="mt-4">It was great speaking with you earlier. As promised, here are the answers to the questions you asked about Course Creator 360:</p>

              <p class="text-red-600 text-xl font-bold mb-4">1. Shopify Integration</p>
              <p class="font-bold">Can products from Shopify and courses on Course Creator 360 be purchased together in one checkout?</p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Currently, combining Shopify products and CC360 courses into a single unified checkout isn't supported. Customers need to complete separate checkouts: one on your Shopify store for physical products and another on CC360 for courses or digital products.</p>

              <p class="font-bold mt-5">How does inventory reconcile if a kit is sold along with a course?</p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Real-time inventory synchronization during the CC360 checkout process isn't available by default. However, you can use webhooks to send data to or from Course Creator 360 automations. If someone checks out a product in Shopify, you can set up an automation that grants access to that user to the course. This allows you to link physical product sales in Shopify with course access in CC360, providing a seamless experience for your customers.</p>

              <p class="font-bold">What anti-piracy measures are in place on the Course Creator 360 platform?</p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">CC360 provides basic content protection by requiring users to log in to access course materials. It doesn't offer advanced Digital Rights Management (DRM) features or encryption specifically designed to prevent piracy.</p>

              <p class="font-bold mt-5">Can the system detect screen recording or prevent piracy (e.g., through OBS or other screen recording tools)?</p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">No, CC360 doesn't have the capability to detect or prevent screen recording through tools like OBS.</p>

              <p class="font-bold mt-5">What support is available if the course content gets pirated? Can Course Creator 360 assist with DMCA takedowns or any other anti-piracy enforcement?</p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">CC360 doesn't provide direct support for anti-piracy enforcement or assistance with DMCA takedown notices. You would need to handle detection and takedown requests independently or through third-party services.</p>

              <p class="font-bold">Can affiliate commission rates be customized on a per-affiliate basis?</p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Yes, you can set custom commission rates for individual affiliates within our affiliate management system.</p>

              <p class="font-bold mt-5">Does the affiliate program set a cookie for tracking purchases over multiple sessions, or is it only within the same session?</p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">CC360 uses cookies to track affiliate referrals, and you can set the cookie duration according to your preference (e.g., 30 days).</p>

              <p class="font-bold mt-5">What is the onboarding process for affiliates, and can you set up an affiliate on their behalf?</p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Affiliates can sign up through a custom sign-up page, or you can manually add them to the system on their behalf.</p>

              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Our infrastructure is primarily hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud servers located in the United States.</p>

              <p class="font-bold mt-5">What measures are in place to protect data, especially considering your audience is tech-savvy and may attempt to probe security vulnerabilities?</p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">We employ multiple security measures, including data encryption, secure data centers, regular security updates, and access controls to protect user data.</p>

              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Currently, our community feature offers basic moderation tools but doesn't include advanced auto-moderation capabilities like automatic filtering or censoring of offensive language.</p>

              <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Yes, CC360 natively supports two-factor authentication (2FA) for user accounts. Users can enable 2FA in their account settings to enhance account security.</p>
