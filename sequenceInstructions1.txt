CATEGORY 1: Lead Magnet Follow Up Sequence (Goal: Deliver FREE Value & Close The Sale)
A series of emails sent after a lead receives your lead magnet that are intended to push them to a purchase.
Anywhere from 3-5 emails that will follow the actual delivery of the lead magnet
Emails tend to be specific to the problem that your lead magnet set out to achieve in the first place (must remain as relevant as possible)
Almost always should include testimonials and social proof. Giving people more reasons to purchase your core offer.
Can still be “value focused” in building more trust, but the real goal is to bring attention back to your core offer that the lead magnet was designed to feed into.
(NOTE) The purpose of the follow up should be to strike while the iron is hot. That’s when people are most likely to buy. The longer they wait the less likely they are to bite.
