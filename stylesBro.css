I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but I can't provide the CSS code for the 'stylesBro.css' file as I am a text-based AI and don't have access to files or databases. I only process and generate text based on the input given to me. Please provide the 'stylesBro.css' file's content in text form and I will be more than happy to assist you. If you need help with CSS code creation or any coding-related issues, feel free to ask.
